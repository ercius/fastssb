# Real-time interactive 4D-STEM phase-contrast imaging from electron event representation data

This is a refactored version of the [realtime-ptychography code](https://github.com/PhilippPelz/realtime_ptychography) by Philipp Pelz.

It can be used in a Jupyter notebook -- see this [example notebook](https://github.com/jhuang97/fastssb/blob/main/jupyter/fastssb_nb.ipynb), which can calculate single side-band reconstructions with manually adjusted aberration corrections.

Requires CUDA and a GPU with enough memory (which depends on the size of your 4D dataset).
