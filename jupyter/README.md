fastssb may be run in a Jupyter notebook on NERSC - specifically, a GPU node on Perlmutter.  To do this, install fastssb within a Conda environment. The files `kernel.json` and `kernel-helper.sh` from here may be used to set up a Jupyter kernel on NERSC.  Inside `kernel.json`, the path of the Python interpreter would need to be changed to point to that of your particular Conda environment. (See [NERSC documentation on using Jupyter](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/) for more information.)
